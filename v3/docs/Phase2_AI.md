## Introduction

Phase 2 represents a significant evolution in our recommendation system, moving from basic recommendations to a financially-aware, intelligent system that understands and adapts to user behavior. Think of it as upgrading from a simple store clerk who remembers what customers buy, to a personal shopping assistant who understands your budget, risk tolerance, and shopping patterns.

The key improvements include:

1. **Integration of financial intelligence**
   - Like having a financial advisor alongside your shopping assistant
   - Helps users make financially responsible purchasing decisions
   - Provides personalized financial advice based on spending patterns

2. **Implementation of hybrid recommendation approaches**
   - Similar to combining advice from multiple expert sources
   - Each approach contributes its strengths while compensating for others' weaknesses
   - Dynamically adjusts based on what works best for each user

3. **Enhanced demographic filtering**
   - Understanding that different demographic groups have different needs
   - Like having a shopping assistant who understands cultural and social contexts
   - Considers age, location, income, and lifestyle factors

4. **Advanced content-based filtering**
   - Goes beyond simple category matching
   - Understands the nuanced relationships between products
   - Like having an expert who understands the subtle differences between items

5. **Dynamic weighting system**
   - Learns from user interactions and adjusts its strategy
   - Similar to how a personal assistant learns your preferences over time
   - Automatically emphasizes what works best for each user

6. **Improved cold-start handling**
   - Better at making initial recommendations for new users
   - Like an experienced salesperson who can make educated guesses about preferences
   - Uses available information effectively to start building relevance

## Enhanced Data Structure

### Financial Profile Data (`financial_profiles.csv`)

Think of the financial profile as a financial fingerprint for each user. Just as a fingerprint is unique to each person, a financial profile captures the unique financial behavior and preferences of each user.

New dataset fields and their real-world significance:
- `spending_level`: Like a person's spending habits (frugal vs. luxury shopper)
- `risk_tolerance`: Similar to investment risk tolerance, but for shopping decisions
- `budget_status`: Current financial health indicator
- `monthly_spend`: Establishes spending patterns and capacity
- `preferred_payment`: Indicates financial habits and available payment methods
- `purchase_frequency`: Shows shopping patterns and potential budget distribution

### Enhanced User Profiling

Think of this as building a comprehensive customer persona. Just as a good friend knows your habits and preferences, our system builds a detailed understanding of each user:

- **Purchase history patterns**
  - Like remembering what a friend typically buys in different seasons
  - Identifies cyclical buying behavior
  - Spots preference changes over time

- **Price sensitivity indicators**
  - Understanding when a user is likely to wait for sales
  - Identifying price ranges that trigger purchases
  - Like knowing which friends are bargain hunters vs. premium buyers

- **Category preferences weights**
  - Similar to knowing which stores a friend prefers
  - Understands relative importance of different product categories
  - Tracks category exploration patterns

- **Brand loyalty metrics**
  - Like knowing which brands a friend swears by
  - Identifies strong brand preferences
  - Helps predict willingness to try new brands

- **Seasonal buying patterns**
  - Understanding when users are most likely to shop
  - Identifying category preferences by season
  - Like knowing when friends typically update their wardrobe

## Advanced Recommendation Techniques

### Hybrid Recommendations

Imagine a council of experts, each specializing in different aspects of recommendations. The hybrid system is like having these experts collaborate and vote on recommendations, with their votes weighted based on their past success.

#### 1. Weighted Hybrid Approach

The intuition behind the weighted hybrid approach is similar to getting advice from multiple trusted sources:

```python
def get_hybrid_recommendations(user_id, weights):
    """
    Think of this as collecting opinions from different experts:
    - Collaborative expert (knows what similar users like)
    - Content expert (understands product features)
    - Demographic expert (knows what similar people prefer)
    
    The weights determine how much we trust each expert's opinion.
    """
    # Get recommendations from each approach
    collab_recs = get_collaborative_recommendations(user_id)
    content_recs = get_content_recommendations(user_id)
    demo_recs = get_demographic_recommendations(user_id)
    
    # Combine recommendations with weights
    final_scores = {}
    for item_id in set(collab_recs) | set(content_recs) | set(demo_recs):
        final_scores[item_id] = (
            weights['collaborative'] * collab_recs.get(item_id, 0) +
            weights['content'] * content_recs.get(item_id, 0) +
            weights['demographic'] * demo_recs.get(item_id, 0)
        )
    
    return sorted(final_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

#### Real-world Analogy
Imagine shopping with three friends:
1. One who knows what similar people bought (collaborative)
2. One who knows products in detail (content-based)
3. One who understands your demographic (demographic)

Each friend's opinion is weighted based on how good their past recommendations were.

#### 2. Dynamic Weight Adjustment

Think of this as learning which friend gives the best advice in different situations:

```python
def adjust_weights(user_id, base_weights, financial_profile):
    """
    Like learning to trust different friends' advice in different situations:
    - Risk-averse friend's advice matters more for big purchases
    - Style-conscious friend's opinion matters more for fashion
    - Budget-conscious friend's input matters more when money is tight
    """
    adjusted_weights = base_weights.copy()
    
    if financial_profile['risk_tolerance'] == 'low':
        # Increase weight of demographic-based recommendations
        adjusted_weights['demographic'] *= 1.2
        adjusted_weights['collaborative'] *= 0.8
    elif financial_profile['spending_level'] == 'high':
        # Increase weight of content-based recommendations
        adjusted_weights['content'] *= 1.3
        adjusted_weights['demographic'] *= 0.7
    
    # Normalize weights to sum to 1
    total = sum(adjusted_weights.values())
    return {k: v/total for k, v in adjusted_weights.items()}
```

### Content-Based Filtering Enhancements

Phase 2 introduces advanced content analysis:

#### 1. TF-IDF for Item Description Analysis

```python
def compute_item_vectors():
    """Compute TF-IDF vectors for item descriptions"""
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
        max_features=1000,
        stop_words='english',
        ngram_range=(1, 2)
    )
    
    # Create item description matrix
    descriptions = [item['description'] for item in items]
    item_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(descriptions)
    
    return item_vectors, vectorizer
```

#### 2. Attribute Weighting System

```python
def calculate_item_similarity(item1, item2, weights):
    """
    Calculate weighted similarity between items
    
    weights = {
        'category': 0.3,
        'brand': 0.2,
        'price_range': 0.1,
        'tags': 0.4
    }
    """
    similarity = 0
    
    # Category similarity
    if weights['category']:
        cat_sim = 1 if item1['category'] == item2['category'] else 0
        similarity += weights['category'] * cat_sim
    
    # Brand similarity
    if weights['brand']:
        brand_sim = 1 if item1['brand'] == item2['brand'] else 0
        similarity += weights['brand'] * brand_sim
    
    # Price range similarity
    if weights['price_range']:
        price_sim = 1 - abs(item1['price'] - item2['price']) / max_price_diff
        similarity += weights['price_range'] * price_sim
    
    # Tags similarity
    if weights['tags']:
        tags_sim = len(set(item1['tags']) & set(item2['tags'])) / \
                  len(set(item1['tags']) | set(item2['tags']))
        similarity += weights['tags'] * tags_sim
    
    return similarity
```

### Demographic Filtering Improvements

Phase 2 introduces more sophisticated demographic filtering:

#### 1. Multi-factor Demographic Scoring

```python
def calculate_demographic_score(user, item, factors):
    """
    Calculate demographic compatibility score
    
    factors = {
        'age_group': True,
        'gender': True,
        'location': False,
        'income': True,
        'interests': True
    }
    """
    score = 0
    weights = {
        'age_group': 0.25,
        'gender': 0.15,
        'location': 0.1,
        'income': 0.25,
        'interests': 0.25
    }
    
    if factors['age_group']:
        score += weights['age_group'] * age_group_compatibility(user, item)
    
    if factors['income']:
        score += weights['income'] * income_bracket_compatibility(user, item)
    
    if factors['interests']:
        score += weights['interests'] * interest_overlap(user, item)
    
    return score
```

## Financial Intelligence Layer

Think of this layer as a combination of a personal financial advisor and a smart shopping assistant. It helps users make financially responsible decisions while shopping.

### 1. Financial Profile Analysis

Just as a financial advisor assesses your financial health before making recommendations:

```python
def analyze_financial_profile(user_id):
    """
    Like a financial check-up that considers:
    - How much you can comfortably spend
    - Your comfort level with large purchases
    - Your current financial situation
    
    This helps tailor recommendations to your financial reality.
    """
    profile = get_user_financial_profile(user_id)
    
    spending_capacity = calculate_spending_capacity(
        profile['income_bracket'],
        profile['monthly_spend'],
        profile['budget_status']
    )
    
    risk_factor = calculate_risk_factor(
        profile['risk_tolerance'],
        profile['spending_level'],
        profile['purchase_frequency']
    )
    
    return {
        'spending_capacity': spending_capacity,
        'risk_factor': risk_factor,
        'budget_status': profile['budget_status']
    }
```

### 2. Price Sensitivity Filtering

```python
def filter_by_price_sensitivity(recommendations, financial_profile):
    """Filter and adjust recommendations based on price sensitivity"""
    filtered_recs = []
    
    for item in recommendations:
        price_ratio = item['price'] / financial_profile['spending_capacity']
        
        if price_ratio > 0.8 and financial_profile['risk_tolerance'] == 'low':
            # Skip expensive items for risk-averse users
            continue
            
        if price_ratio > 0.5 and financial_profile['budget_status'] == 'tight':
            # Skip items that might strain the budget
            continue
            
        # Add financial advice for borderline cases
        if 0.4 < price_ratio < 0.8:
            item['financial_advice'] = generate_financial_advice(
                item, financial_profile
            )
            
        filtered_recs.append(item)
    
    return filtered_recs
```

### 3. Financial Advice Generation

```python
def generate_financial_advice(item, financial_profile):
    """Generate personalized financial advice for recommendations"""
    advice = []
    
    # Price-based advice
    if item['price'] > financial_profile['spending_capacity'] * 0.5:
        advice.append({
            'type': 'warning',
            'message': 'This item represents a significant expense relative to your typical spending.'
        })
    
    # Budget status advice
    if financial_profile['budget_status'] == 'tight':
        advice.append({
            'type': 'suggestion',
            'message': 'Consider waiting for a sale or exploring more affordable alternatives.'
        })
    
    # Risk tolerance advice
    if financial_profile['risk_tolerance'] == 'low' and item['price'] > 100:
        advice.append({
            'type': 'caution',
            'message': 'This purchase may be outside your comfort zone for spending.'
        })
    
    return advice
```

## Enhanced Similarity Metrics

Phase 2 introduces more sophisticated similarity metrics:

### 1. Pearson Correlation Coefficient

```python
def pearson_similarity(user1_ratings, user2_ratings):
    """
    Calculate Pearson correlation between two users' ratings
    """
    common_items = set(user1_ratings.keys()) & set(user2_ratings.keys())
    
    if len(common_items) < 5:  # Minimum threshold for reliable correlation
        return 0
    
    # Calculate means
    user1_mean = sum(user1_ratings[item] for item in common_items) / len(common_items)
    user2_mean = sum(user2_ratings[item] for item in common_items) / len(common_items)
    
    # Calculate numerator and denominators
    numerator = sum((user1_ratings[item] - user1_mean) * 
                   (user2_ratings[item] - user2_mean) 
                   for item in common_items)
    
    user1_ss = sum((user1_ratings[item] - user1_mean) ** 2 
                   for item in common_items)
    user2_ss = sum((user2_ratings[item] - user2_mean) ** 2 
                   for item in common_items)
    
    if user1_ss == 0 or user2_ss == 0:
        return 0
    
    return numerator / (math.sqrt(user1_ss) * math.sqrt(user2_ss))
```

### 2. Jaccard Similarity for Categorical Data

```python
def jaccard_similarity(set1, set2, weights=None):
    """
    Calculate weighted Jaccard similarity between two sets
    """
    if not weights:
        return len(set1 & set2) / len(set1 | set2)
    
    # Calculate weighted intersection and union
    intersection = sum(weights.get(item, 1) 
                      for item in set1 & set2)
    union = sum(weights.get(item, 1) 
               for item in set1 | set2)
    
    return intersection / union if union > 0 else 0
```

## Advanced Cold-Start Handling

Phase 2 implements more sophisticated cold-start handling:

### 1. Progressive Profile Building

```python
def build_progressive_profile(user_id):
    """Build user profile progressively with minimal information"""
    profile = {
        'demographic': get_demographic_info(user_id),
        'financial': get_financial_info(user_id),
        'interests': get_initial_interests(user_id)
    }
    
    # Start with demographic-based recommendations
    initial_recs = get_demographic_recommendations(profile['demographic'])
    
    # Adjust based on financial profile
    filtered_recs = filter_by_financial_profile(
        initial_recs,
        profile['financial']
    )
    
    # Further refine based on interests
    final_recs = refine_by_interests(
        filtered_recs,
        profile['interests']
    )
    
    return final_recs
```

### 2. Exploration-Exploitation Balance

```python
def get_exploration_recommendations(user_profile, n=5):
    """Generate recommendations balancing exploration and exploitation"""
    # 70% similar to current interests, 30% exploration
    n_exploit = int(0.7 * n)
    n_explore = n - n_exploit
    
    # Get recommendations similar to current interests
    exploit_recs = get_similar_to_interests(
        user_profile['interests'],
        n_exploit
    )
    
    # Get diverse recommendations for exploration
    explore_recs = get_diverse_recommendations(
        user_profile,
        n_explore,
        exclude=exploit_recs
    )
    
    return exploit_recs + explore_recs
```

## Dynamic Scoring and Ranking

Phase 2 introduces dynamic scoring that adapts to user behavior:

### 1. Multi-factor Scoring

```python
def calculate_recommendation_score(item, user_profile, weights):
    """Calculate final recommendation score using multiple factors"""
    score = 0
    
    # Collaborative filtering score
    cf_score = get_collaborative_score(item, user_profile)
    score += weights['collaborative'] * cf_score
    
    # Content similarity score
    content_score = get_content_similarity_score(item, user_profile)
    score += weights['content'] * content_score
    
    # Demographic compatibility score
    demo_score = get_demographic_score(item, user_profile)
    score += weights['demographic'] * demo_score
    
    # Financial compatibility score
    financial_score = get_financial_compatibility_score(item, user_profile)
    score += weights['financial'] * financial_score
    
    # Temporal relevance score
    temporal_score = get_temporal_relevance_score(item)
    score += weights['temporal'] * temporal_score
    
    return score
```

### 2. Dynamic Weight Adjustment

```python
def adjust_recommendation_weights(user_profile, interaction_history):
    """Dynamically adjust recommendation weights based on user behavior"""
    weights = get_default_weights()
    
    # Analyze successful recommendations
    success_patterns = analyze_successful_recommendations(
        interaction_history
    )
    
    # Adjust weights based on success patterns
    if success_patterns['content_based_success'] > 0.7:
        weights['content'] *= 1.2
    
    if success_patterns['demographic_success'] > 0.7:
        weights['demographic'] *= 1.2
    
    # Adjust based on financial behavior
    if user_profile['financial']['risk_tolerance'] == 'low':
        weights['financial'] *= 1.3
    
    # Normalize weights
    total = sum(weights.values())
    return {k: v/total for k, v in weights.items()}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Phase 2 includes several performance improvements:

### 1. Caching Strategy

```python
class RecommendationCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size=1000):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.access_count = {}
    
    def get(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.access_count[key] += 1
            return self.cache[key]
        return None
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            # Remove least accessed item
            least_accessed = min(
                self.access_count.items(),
                key=lambda x: x[1]
            )[0]
            del self.cache[least_accessed]
            del self.access_count[least_accessed]
        
        self.cache[key] = value
        self.access_count[key] = 1
```

### 2. Batch Processing

```python
def batch_process_recommendations(user_ids, batch_size=100):
    """Process recommendations in batches for better performance"""
    recommendations = {}
    
    for i in range(0, len(user_ids), batch_size):
        batch = user_ids[i:i + batch_size]
        
        # Process batch in parallel
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            batch_results = executor.map(
                generate_recommendations,
                batch
            )
        
        # Store results
        for user_id, recs in zip(batch, batch_results):
            recommendations[user_id] = recs
    
    return recommendations
```
